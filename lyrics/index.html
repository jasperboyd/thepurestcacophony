					Can't we open a blank page,<br />
					release this room burn the sage,<br />
					of old memories, we longer follow,<br />
					while remembering we are not hollow.<br />
					<br />
					We create our own bliss,<br />
					nothing else has to exist,<br />
					we can live in this old world,<br />
					our expectations unfulfilled.<br />
					<br />
					Can't we reveal old bonds broken,<br />
					as we feel, our thoughts awoken,<br />
					there's always time for rebuilding,<br />
					cause we are strong, and we are willing,<br />
					<br />
					We create our own bliss,<br />
					nothing else has to exist,<br />

					I wait for awhile,<br />
					I pace and pile on,<br />
					all of my dreams.<br />

					the more I think,<br />
					the slower I go,<br />
					it seems,<br />
					<br />
					that I'm stuck upon,<br />
					something simple,<br />
					it's elementary,<br />
					<br />
					come back to me,<br />
					come back to me,<br />
					<br />
					im wrapped up in,<br />
					things that never,<br />
					should have been.<br />
					<br />
					my hopes are spent,<br />
					and with them went,<br />
					my last defense,<br />
					<br />
					I am an open wound,<br />
					alone in this room,<br />
					but I am going home soon.<br />
					<br />
					come back to me,<br />
					come back to me,<br />
					<br />
					I don't know if I can,<br />
					life my life's span,<br />
					this far from you.<br />
					<br />
					I haven't a plan,<br />
					I can't even command,<br />
					my own will.<br />
					<br />
					It stop and it starts,<br />
					racing with my heart,<br />
					while my mind is still,<br />
					<br />
					it can't wait for long,<br />
					and I can't stay strong enough,<br />
					to get through,<br />
					<br />
					come back to me<br />

					I will carry onward.<br />
					I will carry onward.<br />

					If it means one look,<br />
					at how we took,<br />
					on all of this time,<br />
					on all of this time.<br />

					The creekbed is crying<br />

					inside it's quiet<br />
					inside it's quiet<br />

					outside a car backfires,<br />
					a yelling pack of liars,<br />
					beneath my window,<br />
					beneath my window,<br />

					a pulsating darkness blinds me,<br />
					where I was tries to find me,<br />

					no I will never return,<br />
					<br />
					dazed in a stupor,<br />
					my only voice inner,<br />
					it's calming,<br />
					<br />
					over and over words tumbling,<br />
					the collective rumbling,<br />
					overtakes me.<br />

					I will never return,<br />
					no I will never return,<br />

					I keep trying to defy the end,<br />
					a wound that time can't even mend,<br />
					but it's alright.<br />
					<br />
					'cause there's no hell no high-water,<br />
					we're not sheep there's not slaughter,<br />
					so do not faulter,<br />
					we will not faulter.<br />

					It's a hard world for us,<br />
					but there isn't anything we can't do.<br />

					And separate eyes lead to better disguises,<br />

					but we can't get away,<br />
					we can't get away.<br />
					<br />
					It's a hard world for us,<br />
					but there isn't anything we can't do.<br />
					<br />
					And being alone was easier before you came,<br />
					moving on is impossible and it remains that:<br />

					This is not the simple way<br />
					This is not the simple way<br />
					but it's out way.<br />

					It's a hard world for us,<br />
